Ethics in Heroic Adventuring
====================================
Copyright 2023 Robert Thiem

A quick mod to restore the original BGEE Siege of Dragonspear "Ethics in heroic adventuring" line to Minsc - now you can experience what the "political" outrage was about at launch!

Licensed under GPL2, because the included WeiDU uses that and it's simpler to just have one.

If starting a new SoD game it will automatically apply with the built in dialogue changes.

If adding to an existing SoD game there's a "MINSC ETHICS" AI script - press S to switch between the original line and the reverted line (from BG1).
